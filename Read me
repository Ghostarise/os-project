Design a scheduler with multilevel queue having two queues which will schedule the
processes on the basis of pre-emptive shortest remaining processing time first algorithm (SROT)
followed by a scheduling in which each process will get 2 units of time to execute. Also note that 
queue 1 has higher priority than queue 2. Consider the following set of processes (for
reference)with their arrival times and the CPU burst times in milliseconds.

Process     Arrival-Time      Bust-Time
p1            0                 5
p2             1                 3
p3              2                 3
p4              4                 1

Calculate the average turnaround time and average waiting time for each process. The input for
number of processes and their arrival time, burst time should be given by the user.
